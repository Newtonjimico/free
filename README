The FreeDiameter daemon implements the Diameter base protocol.
Loadable extensions add the logic of Diameter applications or advanced use of the daemon.
See http://aaa.koganei.wide.ad.jp/ for more information on the project.
FreeDiameter was previously known as the "waaad" project (WIDE AAA Daemon)

This version is not related to the "freediameter" project from Sun, which seems abandoned.
